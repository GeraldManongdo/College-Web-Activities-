    <h2 id="about">Hello! I’m Gerald</h2>
    <p>a passionate web developer and technology enthusiast with a deep love for creating digital experiences that are both functional and beautiful. Ever since I started exploring the world of programming, I’ve been fascinated by the power of technology to solve real-world problems, inspire creativity, and connect people across the globe.</p>
    <p>My journey began with learning the basics of HTML and CSS, which opened the doors to the vast world of web development. Over time, I delved into JavaScript, frameworks like React.js and Vue.js, and backend technologies including Node.js and Express.js. Each step along the way strengthened my problem-solving abilities, attention to detail, and understanding of how users interact with digital products.</p>
    <p>I believe that technology is not just about writing code—it’s about creating experiences that improve people’s lives. That’s why I focus not only on building functional websites and applications but also on ensuring they are intuitive, accessible, and visually appealing. From designing responsive layouts to implementing smooth user interactions, I aim to create solutions that are seamless, engaging, and memorable.</p>
    <p>Beyond development, I enjoy exploring new technologies, learning about UI/UX design, and keeping up with the latest trends in web and mobile development. I thrive in collaborative environments where I can contribute ideas, learn from others, and push the boundaries of what’s possible with technology.</p>
    <p>When I’m not coding or designing, you can find me reading about emerging tech, experimenting with small personal projects, or sharing knowledge with fellow developers. My goal is to continue growing as a developer while creating impactful projects that leave a lasting impression on users.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Professional Philosophy</h2>
    <p>I believe in continuous learning, creativity, and collaboration. Each project is an opportunity to explore new technologies, test innovative ideas, and deliver solutions that exceed expectations. I approach development with both technical precision and a human-centered mindset, ensuring that every project is not only functional but also meaningful to the end user.</p>
    <p>I’m passionate about building projects that solve real-world problems, whether it’s simplifying daily tasks, improving accessibility, or creating tools that empower people and communities.</p>
